# ðŸ˜· Face Mask Detection Using Deep Learning

A **real-time AI-powered face mask detector** designed to keep environments like **hospitals, hotels, and public spaces** safe. Built with **Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and NumPy**, it delivers **high accuracy even on low-resource machines**.

## ðŸš€ Features

* **Real-Time Detection**: Instantly detect masked vs unmasked faces from webcam or video feed.
* **Lightweight & Efficient**: Optimized for fast performance without GPU.
* **Smart Preprocessing**: Uses **MTCNN for face detection**, grayscale enhancement, and face cropping for better accuracy.
* **CNN Model with Boosters**: Implements **dropout, early stopping, and checkpointing**, improving detection by \~20%.
* **High Precision & Speed**: Perfect balance for **real-world deployment**.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

* **Languages & Libraries**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Scikit-learn
* **Techniques**: CNN, MTCNN, Early Stopping, Dropout
